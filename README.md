# Boggle


## Description

A Boggle Game that runs on the terminal! Generates a 5 x 5 board and allows you to set the game length. One player only on the terminal or you can use this
to randomly generate a Boggle Board


## Goals

* Love creating video games so great practice
* C# project written following Google's Styling Guide for C# closely
* Real world application of various matrix, DFS, and leetcode style word search problems


## Future Improvements

* Create a .EXE or equivalent file with this codebase to be ran on the terminal. Need to pass arguments from player's end to initialize game time's length
* Note written, but Replit does not support C# packages installations. SpellNet would be a great way to make words inputted by players are valid English words
* Support for other languages (Spanish, French, etc)
* DFS suffices but can challenge myself with Trie implementation method or iterative DFS to find word in matrix. Iterative DFS may be a good idea to defend against stack overflow
* Create an appealing UI so players can play this more comfortably...
